# Prevalence and trends of major congenital anomalies in Brazil: a study from 2011 to 2020

This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of congenital anomalies in Brazil and their potential association with socioeconomic, gestational and regional factors using data from the Live Birth Information System (Sistema de Informações sobre Nascidos Vivos - SINASC) from 2011 to 2020. From a total population of 29,025,461 live births, a cohort of 240,405 newborns with congenital anomalies was included, who were subsequently categorized as having a single or multiple major malformations. The results suggest that the prevalence of major congenital anomalies in Brazil during the study period varied with the geographic region and was lower than that in developed nations, likely due to lower prenatal detection rates and underreporting.
